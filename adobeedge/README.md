These slides explore how Adobe's Edge Tools can interact in the web development community. Do they provide a useful set of features that will be used religiously? Or do they replace the need for web developers?

A presentation for the Front End North County San Diego meetup group, [June 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Front-end-Dev-North-County-San-Diego/events/183447642/).
